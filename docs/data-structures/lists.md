# Lists

## Plain Ol' Lists

In Python, `if item in list` takes a long time. Try to use `if item in set` when possible.

Python built-in time complexities [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity?).

## Linked Lists

| Operation   | O-complexity |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Space       | O(n)         |
| Pre-/append | O(1)         |
| Lookup      | O(n)         |
| Insert      | O(n)         |
| Delete      | O(n)         |

Ideal for implementing stacks and queues.
